# Zhenxi (PhotoManager)

**Zhenxi** — local photo management software for photographers: fast retrieval (faces / text /
EXIF / folders / arbitrary combinations), thumbnails and full-size viewing,
batch export at common resolutions — **the app never deletes or modifies your original
files**.

## Latest release v0.6.19 (2026-11-05)

> 📋 All version changes: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

- **Fixed**: People page showing "no data" on large person libraries (a
  call-signature mismatch left over from the 0.6.17 avatar-cache rework made
  the paged query fail silently)
- **Improved**: dialogs & search on large person libraries — the "manage
  avatars" dialog now does a single point lookup instead of building the full
  person list; the "move out to person" dialog loads pages with a server-side
  name search; all person search boxes debounce at 250 ms
- **New**: a plain-text UPGRADE note ships inside every package (how to keep
  your `data/` when upgrading over an existing install)
- **Fixed**: the Kylin tarball is now packed inside Linux, so the executable
  bit is preserved — it runs right after extraction, no manual chmod needed
- **Fixed**: person "merge into" dialog search was not wired; merge pickers
  now have search

**English UI**: click the `中 / EN` button at the right end of the top toolbar.
The interface language is remembered across restarts. Missing translations
fall back to Chinese; adding a new language = dropping one JSON file into
`photo_manager/ui/qml/i18n/` (see `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` for tooling notes).

## Official release

  source-availability channel per GPLv3 §6.

## Upgrading

There is no in-app auto-update; upgrading means swapping in a new version
directory manually. Your data lives in `data\` inside the program folder —
move it along. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new in each version.

**Method 1 (recommended): extract the new version to a new folder, migrate data**

1. Extract the new package into a **new folder** (don't overwrite the old one,
   so you can always roll back);
2. Copy the whole `data\` folder from the old directory into the new one at
   `PhotoManager\data\` (library, thumbnails and backups are inherited; your
   original photos live outside the app and are untouched; UI settings are
   stored in system config and carry over automatically);
3. Launch the new `PhotoManager`, verify everything is fine, then delete or
   archive the old folder.

**Method 2: extract over the old folder** — fully exit the app first
(including the tray icon), then extract the new package over the old folder.
`data\` is not part of the package and won't be overwritten; if extraction
complains about files in use, the app hasn't exited completely.

**Notes**:

- The program folder must be **writable** (avoid protected locations like
  Program Files; `D:\PhotoManager` is recommended);
- Run "Tools → Backup" in the old version before upgrading; for releases with
  database schema changes, the new version migrates automatically on first
  launch — a pre-upgrade backup keeps you safe either way;
- Moving the program folder together with `data\` to another PC or drive is
  fine (thumbnail paths are relative); if your original photos moved too,
  affected photos show as missing — update the scan roots and re-import.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 x86_64, or Kylin V10 desktop aarch64 (Phytium / Kunpeng)
- Fully offline: all dependencies and AI models ship inside the package

## Tech stack

| Component | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language / UI | Python + PySide6 (Qt Quick / QML) |
| Database | SQLite (WAL + FTS5) |
| RAW decoding | rawpy (LibRaw) |
| OCR | RapidOCR (PP-OCRv4 ONNX, offline) |
| Faces | YuNet detection + SFace recognition (ONNX) |
| Semantic search | Chinese-CLIP ViT-B/16 (ONNX, offline) |

## Documentation

- 中文说明与操作指南：软件内「帮助 → 使用说明」（HelpDialog），离线内置
- Dependencies & platform differences: [docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md)
- i18n architecture: `photo_manager/ui/qml/i18n/I18n.qml` (data-driven
  language packs; new languages need no code changes)

## Feature highlights

- Ingest / EXIF / thumbnails / search / export engine
- OCR / face recognition / auto grouping / smart albums
- Two-machine metadata sync / duplicate detection / advanced search / backup
- Rating & pick/reject flags, color labels, bulk tagging, albums, events,
  people (face clusters), places, devices, timeline, statistics, map, trash
- Bulk time shift, metadata CSV export, slideshow, video playback
- Semantic search (`clip:` syntax), scene auto-tagging, duplicate finder
- Integrity check + deep decode check for damaged files
- Scheduled tasks (in-app timer or OS scheduler), tray mode, launch at startup

## Development

```
python -m photo_manager.main          # GUI
python tests/smoke_ui.py              # QML smoke (offscreen)
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```

See [docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) for packaging notes
(Windows PyInstaller / Kylin aarch64 Docker, glibc constraints).

### Building from source

Full three-platform build instructions: **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)**
(mirrors CI `.github/workflows/release.yml` step by step — following it yields
packages identical to the official Release).

```powershell
# Windows (simplest)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tools\fetch_models.py     # downloads CLIP x2 + geo.sqlite (~750MB, sha256-verified)
python tools\build_win.ps1       # PyInstaller + smoke self-test -> dist\PhotoManager\
```

Kylin V10 aarch64 needs no ARM hardware — any Docker-capable x86_64 machine
cross-builds via `tools/arm/kylin.Dockerfile` (glibc 2.31 base). The legacy
`tools/arm/build_kylin.sh` misses critical runtime-library closure steps and
must not be used for shipping.
